# Guvi Courses Ratings Prediction Project

## Overview
The Guvi Courses Ratings Prediction Project aims to develop a regression model to predict the ratings given by learners to Guvi courses. The dataset used in this project contains information about various Guvi courses, including course title, URL, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, course level, content duration, published timestamp, and subject. By analyzing this dataset and building a regression model, we can predict the ratings of courses and identify factors that influence course ratings.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **course_title**: The title of the Guvi course (String).
- **url**: The URL of the Guvi course (String).
- **price**: The price of the Guvi course (Float).
- **num_subscribers**: The number of subscribers for the Guvi course (Integer).
- **num_reviews**: The number of reviews for the Guvi course (Integer).
- **num_lectures**: The number of lectures in the Guvi course (Integer).
- **level**: The level of the Guvi course (String).
- **Rating**: The rating of the Guvi course (Float).
- **content_duration**: The content duration of the Guvi course (Float).
- **published_timestamp**: The timestamp of when the Guvi course was published (Datetime).
- **subject**: The subject of the Guvi course (String).

## Objective
The main objective of the project is to design a regression model that accurately predicts the ratings given by learners to Guvi courses. By leveraging features such as course attributes, level, content duration, and other factors, the regression model will learn patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions about course ratings.

## Steps to Execute the Project
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of features and target variable (ratings).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and any other necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of the regression model.
4. **Model Building**: Build and train regression models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, etc.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, etc.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing regression model to optimize its performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the final regression model for real-world use, if applicable.
